  venue: Science Advances
  description: We analyze 15 years of daily census tract–level data to quantify coexposure to extreme heat, wildfire burn zones, and smoke across 11 Western U.S. states. Coexposures—especially between heat and smoke—increased over time and disproportionately affected vulnerable and Indigenous populations.
