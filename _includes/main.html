    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        I am a Research Scientist at the <strong><a href="https://futuretech.mit.edu">FutureTech</a></strong> Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I have affiliations with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the MIT Sloan School of Management. Additionally, I am an Associate with the <strong><a
    href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu">Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS)</a></strong> at Harvard University. My work focuses on exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), science, and society, aiming to advocate for improved research practices and policies. I specialize in topics such as the science of science, open-source software and AI, computational social science, and research reproducibility. Currently, I am examining the AI trends in science, focusing on its applications, scaling effects, potential for de-democratization, and the importance of open-source solutions. Additionally, I am interested in climate research, particularly in extreme climate events, environmental justice, and the applications of AI for climate solutions.
